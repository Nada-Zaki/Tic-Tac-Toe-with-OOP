# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-OOP
This is a python program which uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first and then asks the player to choose his marker (X or O) and then asks him for his next position (as a number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.
If one of the players win, it will ask them if they want to play again or not.
